# Devfolio: Developers Portfolio App

Welcome to the Developer Portfolio App! This project is an Android application designed to serve as a comprehensive portfolio for developers. It offers a clean and visually appealing user interface following the principles of UI-UX and Material Design. Built this responsive app using the best practices from the Android Community to show my skills and passion for design and development.

## Features

- The App uses GitHub API to retrieve real-time information such as user profile details and pictures, repositories, followers, following, bookmarked repos, etc. Users need not have a GitHub profile to access these profiles.
- Users can take inspiration and reference for their next project using this feature. (Web-view of repositories)
- The app provides a dedicated section for me to showcase my skills through a portfolio.
- This section allows me to display my professional experience, projects I have worked on, education, skills, and other relevant information.
- The user interface of the app is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly. It enables seamless navigation and provides an immersive experience for visitors.
